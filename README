NOTE: This is an alternative approach to make your CGI.pm aware applications
to enable PSGI protocol. The API and implementation are different from what you
get in psgi_support branch in markstos' git repo [1], even though the module
name (CGI::PSGI) is the same.

[1] http://github.com/markstos/CGI.pm/commits/psgi_support

The key difference is that you need to change your application from:

  my $q = CGI->new;
  print $q->header, $body;

to

  use CGI::PSGI;
  sub app {
      my $env = shift;
      my $q = CGI::PSGI->new($env);
      return [ $q->psgi_header, [ $output ] ];
  }

This module doesn't require patching CGI.pm core.

This is Perl module CGI::PSGI.

INSTALLATION

CGI::PSGI installation is straightforward. If your CPAN shell is set up,
you should just be able to do

    % cpan CGI::PSGI

Download it, unpack it, then build it as per the usual:

    % perl Makefile.PL
    % make && make test

Then install it:

    % make install

DOCUMENTATION

CGI::PSGI documentation is available as in POD. So you can do:

    % perldoc CGI::PSGI

to read the documentation online with your favorite pager.
